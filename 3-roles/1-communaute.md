# Community

The community of users of the digital commons is always the ultimate decision maker. The ways in which the community expresses itself are to be determined by each commons.

The various roles that enable the common to be applied must themselves be subject to scrutiny to ensure that they apply it. The most legitimate body to scrutinise is the community as a whole.

## Risks addressed by the role

### Non-abiding by the common <a href="#respect-regles" id="respect-regles"></a>

If the different stakeholders described in this section overstep their roles or conversely do not fulfill them properly, only the community can (and must) replace them.&#x20;

Therefore, all roles must be held transparently for all members.

### Uselessness of the service <a href="#utilite" id="utilite"></a>

Without community, the digital commons is but an empty shell. The community and its involvement is the first measure of both health and usefulness of the digital commons.

## Legal Form

The community is always to be considered as a multitude \[Colin & Verdier, 2015], and not as a legal person or a class that can be represented by a subset of its members.
