# Strategy

As well as limiting the risks of re-appropriation of the means of producing value, there is the question of how to engage resources already shared.

## Publishing Improvement Requests <a href="open-requests" id="open-requests"></a>

In the context of democratic governance, the general roadmap of the service is theoretically based on the needs expressed by the community. However, arbitrations must be carried out on the basis of available resources. If these arbitrations systematically favour a certain type of stakeholder, there is a _de facto_ re-appropriation of the shared resources in the sense that, over time, the digital service will bring increasing value to certain users at the expense of those for whom the investment could not be made. The way in which strategic orientations are defined should therefore be considered as a component of the service and subject to appropriate governance.

**A minimum constraint is the publication of users' requests for evolution.**

**Operational recommendation: consolidate user feedback either directly into the software forge through "tickets" or "issues", or through a dedicated tool**.

## Publishing Available Resources <a href="open-means" id="open-means"></a>

In order to allow the community to participate properly in the arbitration between needs and means, limited and measurable resources must be accessible at least to the community, as for example the financial means of the structure which operates the service.

**A minimum constraint is the publication of the means invested and available for the evolution of the service.**

**Operational recommendation: publish a budget document of the past and planned means invested in the service.**

## Documenting Arbitrations <a href="arbitrations" id="arbitrations"></a>

The arbitration procedures based on this information may be synchronous, such as a general assembly, delegated to elected representatives, or based on asynchronous and shared decision-making tools. In all cases, they must be described publicly and, if the entity operating the service has formed a legal structure, in a statutory or regulatory document.

**A minimum constraint is the description of how the available resources are to be invested.**

**Operational recommendation: to maximise participation without geographical or time constraints, favour asynchronous and shared decision-making tools such as **[**Loomio**](https://www.loomio.org)** and information meetings that are at least recorded and broadcast.**
