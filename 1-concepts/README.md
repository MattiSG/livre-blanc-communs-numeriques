# Concepts

Prior to unfolding the reasoning, I have to clarify the vocabulary and concepts that are necessary to understand it properly.

Even if you think you are familiar with terms related to the commons, public policy, and the digital world, I recommend a quick read of these chapters because these terms are often used ambiguously, while I use them here with a precise meaning. In any case, feel free to come back to them as you read!

If the importance, issues and questions raised by the commons are still not clear after reading this section, some metaphors are available in the appendix.
